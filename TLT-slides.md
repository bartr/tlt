# Store Modernization with Azure Edge - Domino's

### The Problem

The maintenance burden and complexity associated with managing large numbers of stores and clusters is leading to the inability of the Domino’s platform engineers to update the stores and applications in a timely manner.

### Opportunity

We have developed a set of tools designed to streamline application management across highly distributed platforms so that we can provide maximum flexibility, resiliency, and velocity while minimizing costs.

### Meeting our customers where they are

- Implemented "Office Hours" for hands-on collaboration

    - Azure, Kubernetes, AKS EE, Arc, and GitOps
    - PG group representation - support us as needed and provide status updates to Arc PG
- Create a judgement free zone where Domino’s can participate at their own pace

### One Microsoft Collaboration

- Collaboration across ISD, GBB, Azure Edge, the account team.
- Collaborated with Azure Edge team on AKS EE at scale, contributing to a new Arc-enabled project.
- Utilized Dominos work to create an OSS repository demonstrating Arc for GitOps at scale.
- Fostered collaboration with various teams (Accenture, ISD, GBB, Azure Edge, and account team), enhancing One Microsoft approach.
- Built a seamless inner-loop Kubernetes development environment using AKS EE on DevBox in collaboration with DevDiv and Azure Edge.

    - _The "why" is why I want Bart and ISE involved. The work they've done on making the app development, deployment, and management process hum at Domino's is the core value for them. Our platform just enables it. In other words, stay away from the infra, focus on the app and the app platform that the infra enables._
